How to extract this .WPress file

    1. Create a directory where you wish your files to be extracted to
    2. Copy the extractor (wpress-extractor.exe) to that directory
    3. Copy the .wpress file to that directory as well
    4. Open up a command prompt
    5. CD into the directory you just created, let's say its C:\Wordpress-Backup. The command you'll run would be cd C:\Wordpress-Backup
    6. Now run the following command wpress-extractor <name-of-your.wpress file>. For example my .wpress file was fifthsegment.wpress so the command I ran was wpress-extractor fifthsegment.wpress.
    7. You'll find your files extracted into the same directory where the extractor was run.
